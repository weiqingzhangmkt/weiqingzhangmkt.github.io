Welcome to my site! 

I am a PhD candidate in Marketing at the Stern School of Business, New York University. I'll be joining the Jones Graduate School of Business
Business school, Rice University as an Assistant Professor in Marketing in July 2024!

My research primarily focuses on the field of quantitative marketing, aiming to understand consumer preferences and choices, as well as firm decisions. To achieve these objectives, I use various empirical methods, including structural modeling, causal inference, field experiments, natural language processing, and machine learning. Substantively, my current research encompasses the following three areas: media content creation and consumption, small businessesâ€™ welfare on e-commerce platforms, and dynamics of customer product returns.
