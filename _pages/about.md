Welcome to my site! 

I am an assistant professor of marketing at Rice University.

My research primarily focuses on the field of quantitative marketing, aiming to understand consumer preferences and choices, as well as firm decisions. To achieve these objectives, I use various empirical methods, including structural modeling, causal inference, field experiments, natural language processing, and machine learning. Substantively, my current research encompasses the following three areas: media content creation and consumption, small businessesâ€™ welfare on e-commerce platforms, and dynamics of customer product returns.
