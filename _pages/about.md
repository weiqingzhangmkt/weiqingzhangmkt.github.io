Welcome! 

I am a PhD candidate in Marketing at Stern School of Business, New York University. 

My research mainly focuses on digital platform applications, with an emphasis on understanding the interplay between platform design, user behaviors, and outcomes.
The research approach I employed is primarily empirical, including structural models, causal inference, field experiments, and machine learning techniques.
