Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Marketing at Stern School of Business, New York University

My research primarily focuses on the field of quantitative marketing, aiming to understand
consumer preferences and choices, as well as firm decisions. To achieve these objectives,
I use various empirical methods, including structural modeling, causal inference, field experiments, 
natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning. Substantively, my
current research encompasses the following three areas: media content creation and consumption, 
small businessesâ€™ welfare on e-commerce platforms, and dynamics of customer
product returns.
